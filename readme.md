## Description 
This is a notes app that allows you to save and delete snippets. The initial home page will have a button that will direct you to a secondary page. This secondary page will have a section for a title and another section for the actual notes being jot down. After hitting save it will save the snippet on the left column of the page. You will be able to click on notes already written down to view them again. You could also delete them afterwards. There is also another button in the shape of a pencil to write down another note. Stay organized friendsâ€¦
